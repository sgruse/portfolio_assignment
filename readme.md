This is my portfolio in which I will represent myself to my future employers.  It will contain links my chosen social medias as well as my github page to show off my current and past projects.  

Tuesday Feb. 2nd: Today I created work.js and made a method to hide the contents on my page according to which tab the user clicks on.  I tried to use the icomoon icons as well but was unable to get them to work before the end of the day.  I still need to do a lot more styling and get my icons working.
